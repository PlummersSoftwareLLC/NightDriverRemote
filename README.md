This is a sample ESP32 project for the Heltec WifiKit 32 V2; it shows how to use the ESPNOW command packets to control the current effect of a NightDriverStrip instance that has been set to the PLATECOVER project.

PLATECOVER has a set of (currently) 7 effects that have to match the table in this executable or it won't work properly.  PLATECOVER also has WIFI off, which is a pre-requisite for receiving ESPNOW commands.
